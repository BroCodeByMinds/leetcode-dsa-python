# ðŸ§  LeetCode DSA â€“ Python Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to LeetCode problems, written in Python.

âœ… Problems are organized by **patterns** like Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Binary Search, etc.  
ðŸ“Œ Each folder includes:
- Problem link
- Clean and readable solution code
- Comments and key insights where applicable

ðŸ§  My goal is to solve **200+ problems** consistently and strengthen my problem-solving skills.

## ðŸ§© Patterns I'm Following

- Sliding Window
- Prefix Sum
- Binary Search
- Two Pointers
- Hashing
- DFS / BFS
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees & Graphs
- Greedy
- Dynamic Programming (coming soon)

---

## âœ… Weekly Goals

- [x] Solve at least 5 problems/week
- [ ] Add explanations for each solution
- [ ] Publish learnings on LinkedIn every Sunday

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

You can browse problems by folders based on patterns.  
Each `.py` file includes a problem link, approach, and comments.

```bash
cd sliding_window/
cat max_subarray_sum.py
