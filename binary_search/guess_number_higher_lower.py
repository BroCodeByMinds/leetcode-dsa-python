# Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/
# Tags: Binary Search
# Approach: Use binary search between 1 and n
# Time Complexity: O(log n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)

# NOTE: In a real LeetCode submission, guess() is predefined.
# For local testing, we simulate it below.

# Simulated pick value for testing
pick = 6

    - returns 1 if num is too low

    if num == pick:
        return 0
    elif num > pick:
        return -1

class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:

            result = guess(mid)

            else:
                left = mid + 1   # Guess is too low

        return -1  # Should never happen if pick âˆˆ [1, n]


# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = Solution()
    print(s.guessNumber(10))  # Output: 6
